            <h3>Detect No. of P_tags and make ther background "Blue" :</h3>
        <p id = "1">Life is full of ups and downs. I know this is a cliché, but this phrase summarizes my whole existence. 
        Sometimes my life is fun, happy and almost enviable and at other times my life is boring, sad, uninspiring 
        and sometimes downright disgusting. I know I am not perfect, I have never tried to be, but one thing is true – 
        <b>I AM WHO I AM.</b></p>

        <p id = "2">My name is Neel S. Deshpande. I live in Amravati. I am an Indian. I am the first born of my parent.
        We are four in number and I have always felt responsible for my family. 
        I love my parents and siblings dearly and the feeling is mutual.</p>

        <p id = "3">I am not perfect and I have never claimed to be. However, I know what I want out of life and I pursue it 
        doggedly. I am a focused person and it has often been said of me that I am quite focused-driven and that I
        have a one-track mind. I don’t know if I should consider that as a compliment or not.</p>

        <p id = "4">I love meeting people and I love making friends with people who are social. I am who I am, and I make no
        excuses for how I have turned out.</p>
