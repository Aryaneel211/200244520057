        <p id = "1">Life is full of ups and downs. I know this is a cliché, but this phrase summarizes my
                    whole existence. Sometimes my life is fun, happy and almost enviable and</br> at other ti-
                    mes my life is boring, sad, uninspiring and sometimes downright disgusting. I know I 
                    am not perfect, I have never tried to be, but one thing is true –<br> <b>I AM WHO I AM.</b>
                    My name is Neel S. Deshpande. I live in Amravati. I am an Indian. I am the first born of 
                    my parent. We are four in number and I have alw-<br>ays felt responsible for my family. I love
                    my parents and siblings dearly and the feeling is mutual.I am not perfect and I have never 
                    claimed to be. However, I <br>know what I want out of life and I pursue it doggedly. I am a fo
                    cused person and it has often been said of me that I am quite focused-driven and that I
                    have a<br> one-track mind. I don’t know if I should consider that as a compliment or not.</p>
