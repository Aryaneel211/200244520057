## Levels of abstraction  
  
  **Cloud provides resources on services or we can
    say cloud provides resources on rent.Different levels of abstraction are as follows,** 

1. Saas - (Software as a service) 
        Here we get any software such as tableau, splank,storm,etc) as a service.

2. Paas - (Platform as a service)
        These are developer faceing services i.e., these services are used on daily basis such as (hosted) database, 
hadoop, etc.

3. Iaas - (Infrastructure as a service)
        These are raw computing resources such as VM(EC-2), disk(volume),etc.

## Security

Security in AWS contains its own firewall which is known as security group. Whenever the traffic comes initially in
security group and then goes to OS.
security group contains Inbound & outbound rules as well. There the security rules are attach to EC-2. We can attach 
multiple security group rules to EC-2.

## S3 service

S3 is storage secure service,which is a storage engine where we can store any data as an object. We have to create 
"Bucket" inside S3 to insert and store the data. Bucket is similar to folder where we can create anather folder inside 
it ar we can directly store data inside bucket. 
The name of top parent bucket should be unique.We cannot store data without creating bucket inside S3.
