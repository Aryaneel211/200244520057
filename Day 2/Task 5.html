                whole existence. Sometimes my life is fun, happy and almost enviable and at other ti-
                mes my life is boring, sad, uninspiring and sometimes downright disgusting. I know I 
                am not perfect, I have never tried to be, but one thing is true – <b>I AM WHO I AM.</b>
                My name is Neel S. Deshpande. I live in Amravati. I am an Indian. I am the first born of 
                my parent. We are four in number and I have always felt responsible for my family. I love
                my parents and siblings dearly and the feeling is mutual. I am not perfect and I have never 
                claimed to be. However, I know what I want out of life and I pursue it doggedly. I am a fo
                cused person and it has often been said of me that I am quite focused-driven and that I
                have a one-track mind. I don’t know if I should consider that as a compliment or not.
