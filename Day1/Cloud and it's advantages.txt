Cloud is compute resource as rent in which we have to pay for whatever we use.
Cloud computing is the ability to access and manipulate files from a site.
We need an internet connection to access the files (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are all examples of
cloud-based applications).

Consider a cloud as computers with unlimited storage with high processing speed located in specific areas around the globe.
Cloud service providers offer three types of cloud. Private, public and hybrid. 

A. Private is only accessible within an organisation. 
B. Public is accessible to the general public.
C. Hybrid is accessible to both.

1. Cost efficiency: The biggest reason behind companies shifting to Cloud Computing is that it takes less cost than any on-premise technology.

2. High speed: Cloud Computing let us deploy the service quickly.

3. Excellent accessibility: Storing information in the cloud allows us to access it anywhere and anytime.

4. Manageability: Cloud Computing eliminates the need for and maintenance 
                  since the service provider ensures guaranteed delivery of our service 
                  and also takes care of all the maintenance.
